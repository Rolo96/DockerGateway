## API usage

The API was made to be consumed through a Postman client. We assume that you have enough knowledge about how to use this program.

### Login
In order to acces to the system you need to be registered as an user and request for security token. To get the token send a POST to localhost:8086/CompraTEC/login with your credentials as follows:
```
{
  id: 1,
  password: "123"
}
```
The system will return your token, save it. Any other consult you send from now, need this token as a Bearer Token, otherwise your request will be refused. The token is valid for 30 minutes, when it expires you will have to request another one.

### Users
To comunicate to the users microservice, use the following URL:
```
localhost:8086/users
```
#### Consult all users
To consul all the users just send a GET with no params.

#### Consult one user
To consult one user send a GET with the id of the user as a param, or send:
```
localhost:8086/CompraTEC/users?id=1
```
#### Create a new user
To insert an user in the data base send a POST with the following JSON:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstname": "A",
  "lastname": "B",
  "password": "123"
}
```
Remember the id of the users is unique, it will be a conflict if a duplicated id is sent. The API will response with the result of the post.

#### Update an existing user
To update an user send a PUT with the id of the user and the other three attributes as follows:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstname": "A",
  "lastname": "B",
  "password": "123"

The firstname, lastname and password will be updated with the new values. Remember send all the attributes when updating an user, otherwise, missing ones will be updated with a null value or the server will return a conflict.
